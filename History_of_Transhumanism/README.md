The paper deals with the origins of the term ’Transhumanism’.

The most commonly accepted originator of the term is considered British evolutionary biologist and eugenicist Julian Huxley (1887-1975). Huxley had a grand, almost utopian vision for the future of humanity, which also explains his serious commitment to eugenics (he was as much as the president of Eugenics Society at some point). The term was considered to be mentioned first (at least in the direct context) was his paper _Transhumanism_, published in 1957. There is, however, another mention of the term by Huxley in 1951 during the lecture ‘Knowledge, Morality and Destiny’, where he has said: ‘_Such a broad philosophy might perhaps be called, not Humanism, because that has certain unsatisfactory connotations, but Transhumanism. It is the idea of humanity attempting to overcome its limitations and to arrive at fuller fruition._’

While Huxley most certainly has been the great populariser, and even perhaps the first to use it as the name for the new philosophy, the origins of the term date well before him. The invention of the term is most often attributed to the Canadian historian W.D. Lighthall in his work _Proceedings and Transactions_, published in 1940. Here transhumanist scenario is directly attributed to St. Paul from I Corinthians 2:9 ‘_Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has it entered the conception of man._’

Moreover, the _de facto_ Victorian translation of Dane’s _La Comedia_, which was translated to English by Henry Francis Carey in 1814, also mentions the term:

> As Glaucus, when he tasted of the herb,
>
> That made him peer among the ocean gods;
>
> Words may not tell of that transhuman change:

Dante very explicitly makes references to St. Paul in that canto.

The paper states that there is no evidence that Huxley has ever been exposed to Lighhall’s paper.
